Differential Gene Expression Analysis of p53 Gain-of-Function and Loss-of-Function Mutations
This repository contains the results of a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing p53 gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. The primary goal of this analysis was to investigate how these mutations affect gene expression

#Background
p53, known as the "guardian of the genome," is a tumor suppressor protein involved in regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Mutations in the TP53 gene can result in either gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) alterations in the protein's activity. These mutations can drive oncogenesis, though the mechanisms underlying these processes are still not fully understood.

#Project Overview
In this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis to compare the gene expression profiles of cells harboring p53 gain-of-function mutations versus those with loss-of-function mutations. The goal was to identify genes whose expression is significantly altered in each mutation type.

#Key Findings
Our analysis found that Keratins 14 (KRT14) had the most significant upregulation in the gain-of-function p53 mutant samples compared to the loss-of-function samples. This finding suggests that KRT14 may play a key role in the biological processes associated with p53 GOF mutations, potentially serving as a biomarker or a therapeutic target in p53-driven cancers.
